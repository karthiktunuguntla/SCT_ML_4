# Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
The system is capable of recognizing multiple hand gestures from images using deep learning techniques.

This project was developed as part of an **internship project** to demonstrate the complete machine learning pipeline:
- Data preparation
- Image preprocessing
- CNN model building
- Model training
- Batch predictions

## 📂 Dataset
- A small balanced dataset of **1000 hand gesture images** was used.
- Multiple gesture classes such as:
  - Palm
  - Fist
  - Thumbs Up
  - OK
  - Peace
- Dataset was balanced to avoid class bias.
